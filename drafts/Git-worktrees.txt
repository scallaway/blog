git worktrees

===

- Perfect for the power user

- Allow you to work on multiple things at once

- Using lazygit, I can have various features/projects WIP'd and jump back to
  them without issue

- Couple that with Zellij's floating terminal and I can be updating one piece
  of work whilst in the middle of another piece of work

  - Perfect for updating a branch to master/develop and pushing quickly to get
    a PR in the merge queue

- Still retain the branch-based workflow, but now you can have branches off the
  repo at different points in time

  - You're still able to branch off develop/master in that separate worktree if
    you so wish

- They're almost infinitely flexible

- Getting setup is a bit of a pain though, and something you should certainly
  document if you can.
