A new year, a new theme

===

For the last few years, when working in my terminal emulator of choice,
Alacritty, I've been using a theme called No Clown Fiesta [1]. To accompany
that darkness, I'd been using the Kanagawa [2] theme for Neovim. 

I'd struggled for a long time to find a theme that I thought was subtle enough
to be easy on the eyes. It was quite the jump from One Dark Pro [3] (originally
provided by Atom) I'd been using before that.

However, we're now a quarter of a century into the 2000s and I thought it was
the perfect time for a new change. I've been watching quite a lot of
programming streams/videos on Twitch and YouTube and having seen the various
themes people had, I realised I've never been truly happy with my choice.

So I browsed r/Neovim for a bit, as well as a few other sources for colour
scheme inspiration, until I finally settled on what I think will be my theme
for at least the next year (hopefully longer):

This is a fairly popular colour scheme that gets pushed to the top of Reddit
threads asking the same question as I almost all the time - suffice to say the
sub really likes the theme.

And, since I've started using it today, so have I. It's certainly a lot more
colourful than the previous theme I was using, but I'm hoping I can get into
the flow of the colours they've picked and enjoy using it.

I've since swapped my terminal emulator theme, Neovim theme, and Zellij [5]
theme over to it so my whole screen is a very calming dark(ish) blue.
