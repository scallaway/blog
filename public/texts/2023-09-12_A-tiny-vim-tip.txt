A tiny vim tip

===

Just a very small thing that I discovered today whilst doing some research...

When deleting through a line in vim, the _slow_ way is to call "dw" the entire
time up to the word that you want.

However, if you instead use "d/{word}", you're able to type out the pattern
that you want to delete up to.

This is very handy for situations when you're looking at what you want to
delete up to, but you need to go through the entire line to get to it.

Definitely something I'm going to try and commit to memory when I'm writing
anything!
