A desktop experience

---

I'm always looking for ways to improve my desktop experience and having swapped
over to Linux that search has only gotten harder rather than easier.

Given the roots of my Linux knowledge are firmly nestled in Ubuntu, I've always
found GNOME, especially the more recent versions, to be my desktop environment
of choice; albeit with a small helping from the GNOME shell extensions (mainly
dash-to-panel and arc menu).

However, I've always had my eye on a tiling window manager such as i3, as I
know it's very popular with those that want to be more efficient with their
computer interactions.

The problem is, I've always been intimidated by it - they're certainly not for
the feint-hearted.

I've tried previously to get i3 going but fell out of love with it pretty
quickly, mainly due to not being fully dedicated to it. I've had similar
experiences with Regolith, which is meant to be i3 but with less of a learning
gap.
