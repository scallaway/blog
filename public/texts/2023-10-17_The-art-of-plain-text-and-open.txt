The power of plain text and "open"

===

Today I found this exceptional talk [1] on running a collaboration "team" (it
doesn't really matter what project is being collaborated on) purely on
plaintext documents. 

It goes into detail about how a team that only works on documentation can
utilise the power of plaintext documents and git to increase their
productivity.

The ultimate takeaway is that plaintext isn't going away, especially as
software continues to be written to files that are, ultimately, just characters
in a file, and that there should be a higher bar when moving to new technology
solutions that all end up solving the same problem.

What are you using to manage your notes, be it personal or work? I've heard
very good things about Obsidian [2], but it just hasn't seemed to click with me
as it stands. Maybe it will work for you!

The other main takeaway from that talk was to try and build software in the
open as much as possible, and I think I'm going to use that mantra going
forward.

I've previously taken the stance of wanting the software that I present in the
open to be of a standard and somewhat feature complete, but then that isn't
really a genuine reprsentation of how engineers work.

Going forward (and starting today), I'm going to strive to build new software
that I create in the open to begin with where possible. Maybe someone might
benefit from stumbling onto a problem that I've managed to solve.

Step 1, though, is opening the repo for this blog up to the world. The commits
could do with a bit of a cleanup...
