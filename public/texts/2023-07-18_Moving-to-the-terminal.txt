Moving back to the terminal

===

I've been recently trying to consolidate the tools that I use back to the
terminal where possible. 

Currently, most of my day is spent looking through and editing code, of which I
do through vim (the move to which would require a whole different blog post). A
lot of time is spent flicking through different windows, which KDE does not
make super easy.

I already have a pretty decent setup for tmux, which it boots into
automatically, so it makes sense to build on that. As such, the next tool that
I'm trying to bring to the terminal is code reviews.

I recently discovered that Github provides a CLI tool [1] that _almost_ does
everything I need (after some experimenting), but then I discovered octo.nvim
[2] which builds on top of this.

It's 100% going to take a bit of getting used to, and my initial play around
inside a private repo was a bit clunky, but I'm going to challenge myself to
use this in my everyday flow. I can already tell I'm going to need to setup
some aliases, since typing :Octo pr {command} every time really isn't the
nicest thing ever.

I'm probably going to make _very_ good use of vim.keymap.set()!

Edit (21-07-23)

I've already stopped using this.

I realised that it didn't have nearly the features that I was looking for, and
ended up being way too clunky. Which is a real shame, since the idea is so
good.

I think the next best stop is to try and find a TUI for Github, instead of
trying to do everything through vim!
